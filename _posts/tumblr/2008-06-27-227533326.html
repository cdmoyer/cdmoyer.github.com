This veers a bit from my normal posts, but was a great read.  If you have goals, big or small, and feel like you aren't reaching them, give this a read.  The author certainly knows what he's talking about, being a world-travelling, company-starting, web-designing entrepreneur extraordinaire.</p>

This is from remy sharp's blog.  This is a great example of the wonderful tidbits he doles out in helpful posts on this blog.  Lots of great jQuery, regex and Javascript “magic”.</p>

John Resig does it again, releasing another awesome project.  This adds profiling into the callstack of a page utilizing jQuery.  It goes much deeper that the profiling capabilities of firebug, and will be a great help if you have a heavy client-side app using jQuery.</p>

Tim Bray is running a second edition of his Wide Finder project.  The basic premise is that taking advantage of the multiple processors available in modern day powerhouse boxes should be easier.  He provided a fairly trivial application in ruby (72 lines to process gigs of log files for counts and top visited pages).  He then ran it (in 23 hours) for a benchmark on an 8-core, 32-thread Sun T2000.</p>

<p>He's since given out accounts to a handful of others who had code to test on the box and provided some <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/Results">preliminary results</a>.  As you'll see… OCaml apparently rocks, with results coming in at under 10 minutes and less than twice the code footprint of the original.  It's certainly an interesting project to follow.</p>
