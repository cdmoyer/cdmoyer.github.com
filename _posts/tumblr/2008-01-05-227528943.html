title: 'AutoBlogger Update :: 0.9.1'


---

<p>Version <strong>0.9.1</strong> of AutoBlogger is now available.</p>

<p>This includes two changes, one bug fix and one new feature:</p>

<ul><li>—from=aregexhere allows for simplistic “security”  or running multiple blogs from one email account</li>

	<li>The contents of the body are now handled more intelligently.  Formerly, they were doing something screwy with newlines in messages (using stringify() on the mime body, as opposed to open()).  <br/>

It now handles line endings in a way that is intuitive to me:  one new line is treated as white space, whereas two newlines in a row are replaced with <code>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</code></li>
