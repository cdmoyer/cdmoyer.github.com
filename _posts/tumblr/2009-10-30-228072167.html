title: Put Tumblr on Your Site via Javascript
---

<p>Tumblr has an easily accessible API which outputs XML, JSON and JSONP.  A bit of searching didn&#8217;t drum up a cut-and-paste solution, but I was able to roll my own in a few minutes.  I&#8217;m documenting it here, so perhaps Google will lead the next person who needs this to my solution.  Just post the appropriate parts of this script into various parts of your site, and it should just work.  See it in action on <a href="http://inarow.net/">my site</a>.</p>
