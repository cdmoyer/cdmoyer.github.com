<p>For <a href="http://inarow.net/entries/projects/one_evening/autoblogger/">AutoBlogger</a>, I decided to release it under the <span class="caps">MIT</span> (or X11 license, as it were).  Reading a couple, I realized that there had to be a webapp somewhere that would stick my name and such in all the appropriate places.  And there was.</p>

<p>It also generates <span class="caps">BSD</span> licenses (with or without advertising clause).  Sure, it's an incredibly simple application, but I found it useful.</p>
