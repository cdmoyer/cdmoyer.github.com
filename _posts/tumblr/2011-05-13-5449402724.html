title: Feeds I Reads
---

<p>I was in google reader this morning, and thought it might be fun to go through my massive list of feeds and highlight my favorites.  I&#8217;ve got 178 feeds total, although a large chunk are inactive or dormant (like mine is most of the time), so I&#8217;ll probably break this into series of posts.  Based on my blogging record, this will take three years to complete. ;)</p>



<p>Presented in no particular order:</p>



<ul><li><p><a href="http://ejohn.org/category/blog/">John Resig</a></p>



<p>Creator of jQuery and consumate javascript hacker.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray&#8217;s Ongoing</a></p>



<p>Former Sun employee, now Google Android advocate, Tim has some good content.  His older posts about the WideFinder project were really neat&#8230; trying to find which environments made it easiest to take advantage of multiple cores for simple programming tasks.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.philvischer.com/">Phil Vischer</a></p>



<p>Creator of Veggie Tales, his old series of posts about the rise and fall of his company, Big Idea, is a great read.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting.com - Dave Winer</a></p>



<p>Dave is smart, opinionated, and always interesting.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://alblue.bandlem.com/">AlBlue's Blog</a></p>

<li><p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/">Joe Gregorio&#8217;s BitWorking</a></p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/">Cool Tools</a></p>



<p>Just what the title says.  A blog about cool tools.   It&#8217;s why I have a <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002875.php">Skeletool</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://eigenclass.org/R2/">Eigenclass</a></p>



<p>This guy is way too smart for me.  I have no idea how it ended up in my list, but I enjoy his data-heavy discussion about optimizing algorithms.  I think maybe it was <a href="http://eigenclass.org/R2/writings/fast-extensible-simplified-markdown-in-ocaml">this post about benchmarking markdown processors</a> that first led me there.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/">Flagrant Badassery</a></p>



<p>Steven Levithan co-wrote an O&#8217;Reilly book on regular expressions, and his blog archives are filled with great articles about regex and javascript.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a></p>



<p>A great blog with varied topics of interest to those running their own freelance business.  This site and their forums were of great help to me when I started out on my own.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://kol.coldfront.net/devposts/devposts.xml">KoL Developer&#8217;s Feed</a></p>



<p>This one is a bit narcissistic, a feed of forum posts by the developers of KoL.  I like to see if I accidentally said something really stupid yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.eldergame.com/">Elder Game</a></p>



<p>Eric regularly has great posts about games, game design and community management.  <a href="http://www.eldergame.com/2008/06/taming-the-forum-tiger/">This post, Taming the Forum Tiger</a>, is a great example.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a></p>
