title: Hoosgot their Eye on hoosgot.com?

<p>Dear LazyWeb, anyone know of a good HowTo on integrating a mac mini into an entertainment center?  <span class="caps">DVR</span>, web video, music, etc?  My TV does <span class="caps">HDMI</span>, component, and <span class="caps">VGA</span>, which will I want to use?</p>

Also, anyone been following <a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/">hoosgot</a>&#160;?  It's an interesting concept, it uses the technorati APIs and watches for the words “lazyweb” and “hoosgot”.  It then aggregates all the blog posts on one page for people to find an answer.  (Thus my question at the start of the entry.)</p>

<p>It's also available to be “queried” and tracked on twitter.  Just <code>follow @hoosgot</code>.</p>

<p>They've already encountered spammers, and I have no idea if people are actually answering all those questions… but it's a really neat concept.</p>

<p>A bit like casting your questions out onto the ocean in a bottle, and waiting to see what floats back.</p>
