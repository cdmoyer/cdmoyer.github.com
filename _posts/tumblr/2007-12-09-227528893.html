title: 'AutoBlogger Update :: 0.9'


---

<p>Version <strong>0.9</strong> of AutoBlogger is now available.</p>

<p>This is mainly some cleanup and addition of licensing info (“oh boy!”).</p>

<p>It does include one new feature which I've found quite useful. the ability to pass a date in the body of an email, and use that as the publish date.  (I plan to use this for importing my old blogspot blog.)</p>
