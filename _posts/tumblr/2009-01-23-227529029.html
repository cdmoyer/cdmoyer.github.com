title: 'AutoBlogger Update :: 0.9.4'


---

<p>Version <strong>0.9.4</strong> of AutoBlogger is now available.</p>

<p>This is another quick bugfix release, but includes a patch sent to me by Chris Lewis, who patched it to support sending “&gt;date” attributes from the iPhone mail client.  Apparently the iPhone insists on adding whitespace before any line starting with “&gt;”, assuming that it's an indented reply.</p>

<p>In other news, I've moved the main repository to <a href="http://github.com/cdmoyer/autoblogger/tree/master">github</a>, as I'm 100% addicted to git.</p>

<p><strong>AutoBlogger Site:</strong>  <a href="http://www.inarow.net/entries/projects/one_evening/autoblogger/"><a href="http://www.inarow.net/entries/projects/one_evening/autoblogger/">http://www.inarow.net/entries/projects/one_evening/autoblogger/</a></a><br/><strong>Grab it:</strong>  <a href="http://www.inarow.net/static/downloads/autoblogger.tar.gz">Download Tarball</a> or Git Clone (git clone git://github.com/cdmoyer/autoblogger.git)</p>
