title: Blog Action Day 2008 - Poverty


---

<p>Many moons ago when I was blogging regularly, I signed up to participate in Blog Action Day.  It's an even where blogger all agree to focus on a single issue for one day, to create awarness and drive conversation.  This year's topic is Poverty.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have anything too profound to say, so I thought I'd point to a series of articles by one of my favorite bloggers, <a href="http://www.reallivepreacher.com/rlparchive/taxonomy/term/118">real live preacher</a>.  He's a real live preacher (would you imagine?) with a great voice and an interesting point of view.  He also puts his time and money where his mouth is.  <a href="http://www.reallivepreacher.com/rlparchive/taxonomy/term/118">This series</a> of articles details his trip with <a href="http://edgeoutreach.com/">Edge Outreach</a>, an organization who works to provide safe drinking water in developing countries.  Gordon (his real name) took a trip with them, installing water purification systems in the Dominican Republic.  Amazingly, to me, they needed to install a system in a hospital of all places, which didn't have pure water!</p>

<p>It's truly astonishing how many things can be so easily taken for granted.</p>
