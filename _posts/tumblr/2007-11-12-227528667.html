title: One Evening Projects


---

<p>Often, I'll sit down to solve a fairly simple problem, and whip out a software solution.  These projects are varied and sundry:</p>

<ul><li>Cross Implementation MySQL Library for Scheme</li>

	<li>Brute Force Chess Analyzer in Ruby</li>

	<li>Random Tools for Dungeons and Dragons</li>

	<li>Plug-ins and Modifications for assorted existing software</li>

</ul><p>Normally, these projects get completed, put into service and forgotten.  Occasionally, I get ambitious and throw them into version control, to save myself later pain.</p>

<p><strong>One Evening Projects</strong> will be a regular feature here, where I take some extra time to document, describe and package these projects.  Who knows, maybe somebody else will actually benefit.  Most of the time these projects are also learning experiences, and I'll share some of that education as well.</p>

<p>You can browse these projects <a href="/entries/projects/one_evening/">here</a></p>
