title: Ramblings Moved to Tumblr
---

<p>Not exactly sure why.   I decided to make the home page of <a href="http://inarow.net/">inarow.net</a> something else (which isn&#8217;t done yet.)  So, I started shopping around for blogging options.  I see too much of wordpress on the clock, so I wrote that off.  I ended up on tumblr because I liked their API, flexibility and capabilities.</p>



<p>Speaking of API, it was about an hour to import all my posts from bloxsom.</p>



<!-- more -->



<ol><li>Install ruby-tumblr gem</li>

<li>Install RedCloth gem</li>

<li>Whip up a script

<script src="http://gist.github.com/222114.js"></script></li>

<li><p>Run the script</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>find blog/entries/ -type f -name &#8216;*.txt&#8217; | grep -v &#8216;draft/&#8217; | ruby tumbleit.rb</p>

</blockquote></li>
