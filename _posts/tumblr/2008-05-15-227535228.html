title: 'Tweet :: Command-Line Twitter Broadcast with Readline Support'


---

<p>So, after giving <a href="http://b.lesseverything.com/">Allan</a> some feedback about the latest less project, <a href="http://getmorehoney.com/">Get More Honey</a>, we chatted a bit and it came out that I'm a <span class="caps">PHP</span> guy, with a bit of a leaning towards CakePHP.  But, I'll fully admit that I love the ruby language, have played with it quite a bit, but simply never had an opportunity to write a rails app.  People pay me to write <span class="caps">PHP</span> code. ;)</p>

<p>But, it did inspire me to fire up vim and write something in ruby.  (Some day I'll dust off RubyKnight, the chess engine I wrote in ruby after reading <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/iar-20/detail/0691118183/002-5357856-1821657">Behind Deep Blue</a>)  Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby

# Written by Chris Moyer (chris@inarow.net // <a href="http://inarow.net/">http://inarow.net/</a>)

# Do with it whatever you want.  That's public domain, right?</code></pre>

<p>require ‘readline'<br/>

require ‘rubygems'<br/>

require ‘twitter'</p>

<p>user = <span class="caps">ARGV</span><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn0">0</a></sup><br/>

pass = <span class="caps">ARGV</span><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>if&#160;!user or&#160;!pass then<br/>

        puts ‘usage: tweet username password'<br/>

        exit<br/>

end</p>

<p>$0 = “tweet #{user} xxxxxxxx”<br/>

twitter = Twitter::Base.new(user, pass)</p>

<p>while line = Readline::readline('(tweet)&gt; ') do<br/>

        Readline::<span class="caps">HISTORY</span>.push(line)<br/>

        if line.length &gt; 140 then<br/>

                puts “#{line.length – 140} characters too long, try again.”<br/>

        else        <br/>

                begin<br/>

                        twitter.post(line)<br/>

                        puts “Tweeted!”<br/>

                rescue <br/>

                        puts “Failed to tweet! (#{$!})”<br/>

                end<br/>

        end<br/>

end</p>

<p>puts “\nBye!”</p>

<p>It solves my problem of reading twitter via gtalk, and not wanting to open twitter.com to post… while hating when I underestimate the length of my message and being trunctaed.  I can just let this run in window of my screen session, and tweet away.</p>

<p>So, I'd love to hear from the rubyists out there:</p>

<ul><li>What aspects of this are not good, idiomatic ruby practice?</li>

</ul>
