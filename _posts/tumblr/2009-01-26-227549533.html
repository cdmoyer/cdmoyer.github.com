<p><b>What's it About?</b></p>

<p><a href="%E2%80%9Dhttp://couchdb.apache.org/%E2%80%9D">CouchDB</a> is a “distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database.” It features a RESTful API, and a pretty slick way to host apps directly on top of it, without any middleware. A great overview of this concept, CouchDB hosted replicatable apps, can be found on JChris's blog: <a href="%E2%80%9Dhttp://jchris.mfdz.com/code/2008/11/my_couch_or_yours__shareable_ap%E2%80%9D">My Couch or Yours? Shareable Apps Are The Future</a>.</p>

<p>The screencast walks you through the process of installing couchdb and couchapp (from git), running them, and creating your first app. It then steps through some very rudimentary changes to the default app. I hope it's helpful to someone besides me. ;)</p>
