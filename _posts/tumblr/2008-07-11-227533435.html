<blockquote>

<p>If you're a <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmer, chances are you've either run across <span class="caps">PEAR</span> or could get some excellent use out of it. <span class="caps">PEAR</span> is an acronym for <span class="caps">PHP</span> Extension and Application Repository. The creators and maintainers of <span class="caps">PEAR</span> encourage you to pronounce it just like the fruit with the same spelling. But you'll get more than fiber from <span class="caps">PEAR</span>, as you'll learn when you read the rest of this articleâ€¦</p>
