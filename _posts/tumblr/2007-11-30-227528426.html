title: Peace of Mind, Moving /etc into Subversion


---

<p>Having recently moved my various projects to a virtual private server<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, I've been spending a fair amount of time mucking about in various files under /etc.  Being a programmer, and not a sysadmin, at heart, I have a tendency to make my edits and test them out in a rapid-fire fashion.  Most of the time, this is fine, I don't run any high availability services and am fairly careful.  But, it does occasionally leave me wondering why or how I changed something… and how to put things back the way they were.</p>

<p>Being a programmer, I tend to live and breathe in version control, so my first thought was to version my config files.  My primary concerns were twofold:</p>

<ul><li>Security.  I don't want to accidentally expose my /etc directory to the world via the anonymous subversion server I run for projects.</li>

	<li>Breakage.  I know many programs (well, at least sshd) are picky about the permissions and ownership of their config files, and didn't want to break things by managing to munge them all.</li>

</ul><p>In my previous usage of subversion, the process of importing a new project has gone something like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; svn import -m"Initial commit of project foo" foo file:///opt/svn/trunk/

&gt; mv foo foo_back

&gt; svn checkout file:///opt/svn/trunk/foo

&gt; # look around, make sure everything is OK

&gt; rm -rf foo_back</code></pre>

<p>My concern with this was with the process of checking out a whole new copy, worried that the permissions and ownership would change.  I understand that subversion is supposed to preserve permissions, but was still concerned.  As far as security, it decided to simply create a whole new repository, owned and readable only by root (and outside the path served by svnserve).  A short bit of googling later led me to the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#in-place-import">Subversion FAQ's</a> “How can I do an in-place ‘import'”.  The process turned out to be entirely painless:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; sudo svnadmin create /opt/svn_etc

&gt; cd /opt

&gt; sudo chmod -R go-rwx svn_etc/

&gt; svn mkdir file:///opt/svn_etc/etc -m"make empty dir for etc"

&gt; cd /etc

&gt; sudo svn checkout file:///opt/svn_etc/etc .

&gt; sudo svn add *

&gt; sudo svn commit -m"Initial commit of all /etc"</code></pre>

<p>And, done.  To ensure that I never leave some changes dangling, I whipped up a quick shell script and added it to <code>/etc/cron.daily/</code>.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash</code>



<code>SENDMAIL=/usr/sbin/sendmail

EMAIL=chris@inarow.net</code>



<code>OUT=` svn status -q /etc `

echo -n "${OUT}" | grep "" &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; \

	echo -e "To: ${EMAIL}\nSubject: /etc locally modified\nContent-type: text/plain\n\n${OUT}\n" |\

	${SENDMAIL} "${EMAIL}"</code></pre>

<p>For a final check, I verify the local security:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; whoami

cdmoyer

&gt; cd /etc

&gt; svn status passwd

&gt; svn log passwd

svn: Unable to open an ra_local session to URL

svn: Unable to open repository 'file:///opt/svn_etc/etc/passwd'

svn: Can't open file '/opt/svn_etc/etc/passwd/format': Permission denied

&gt; svn diff passwd

&gt; svn diff -r1 passwd

svn: Unable to open an ra_local session to URL

svn: Unable to open repository 'file:///opt/svn_etc/etc/passwd'

svn: Can't open file '/opt/svn_etc/etc/passwd/format': Permission denied

&gt; cd /opt/svn

svn/     svn_etc/

&gt; cd /opt/svn_etc/

-bash: cd: /opt/svn_etc/: Permission denied

&gt; ls /opt/svn

svn/     svn_etc/

&gt; ls /opt/svn_etc/

ls: /opt/svn_etc/: Permission denied

&gt; sudo svn log passwd

[sudo] password for cdmoyer:

<p>All told, this took about 20 minutes, including the googling and monitoring script.  Certainly a worthwhile investment.</p>
