<p>On Monday or Tuesday, the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/iar-20/detail/B000FI73MA/002-5357856-1821657">Kindle</a> started showing up as in-stock and shipping at Amazon.  Having read numerous blog posts about it, I took the plunge and ordered it with free 2-day shipping.  It arrived Friday, and I've been playing with it quite a bit.</p>

<ol><li>The terms of use for the wireless make it very clear that Amazon reserves the right to modify or shut off the service at any point.</li>

	<li>While the bland white design didn't appeal to me online, in real life it's nice.  It just seems to get out of the way, letting you focus on the content.</li>

	<li>I wasn't sure at the time I purchased, but it does come with a nicely designed protective jacket.</li>

	<li>I'm sure this is the norm with modern e-book readers, but the screen is incredibly comfortable for reading.  The claims of “electronic paper” are pretty accurate.</li>

	<li>Before it even arrives, Amazon adds “send to my kindle” and “send preview to my kindle” links for all books with kindle editions.  I sent several previews on Thursday, it arrived Friday… I turned it on, registered it, and had content on the device a few minutes later.</li>

	<li>While not full-featured, the browser is more than adequate for mobile gmail, mobile google reader (they aren't getting me to pay for blogs) and some light surfing.  Reading the web in black-and-white is an interesting experience.</li>

	<li>I'm torn about the magazines.  I subscribed to <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/iar-20/detail/B000N8V3FU/002-5357856-1821657">Fortune</a> and compared to the hard-copy I read through at my dad's house it's a bit lacking.  This is primarily because the kindle edition is missing all the photos.  But it's convenient, decent content, and I think I'll probably keep the subscription.</li>

	<li>Two “next page” buttons, large and well placed, make it comfortable to read in a variety of positions.  It's a tad heavier than a paperback, but certainly lighter and more conventient than a hardcover.</li>

	<li>The convenience of sending documents for conversion seems worth the 10 cent charge to me, when I weighed the annoyance of getting out the cable and hooking it up and futzing around.  (Perhaps I'll break down later and do some bulk conversion)</li>

	<li>Amazon makes it very, very (dangerously) easy to buy content.  The free previews (which seem to be in the 2-4 chapters) are enough to get you hooked… and then that “buy now” link appears at the end, making the full book a click away.</li>
