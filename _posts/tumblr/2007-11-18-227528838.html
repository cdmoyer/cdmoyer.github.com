title: 'Dead Simple Photo Blog by Email :: AutoBlogger'


---

<p><strong>Goal:</strong>  Live up to my photoblog's name, <em>Proudestfather</em>, by updating it with adorable pictures on a regular basis.  <br/><strong>Plan:</strong>  Whip up a quick perl script which will take emails from an email account, parse, create thumbnails, and generate static <span class="caps">HTML</span>.<br/><strong>Results:</strong> <a href="/static/downloads/autoblogger.tar.gz">Download Tarball</a>  — Anonymous <span class="caps">SVN</span> (svn co svn://inarow.net/trunk/autoblogger) — <a href="http://proudestfather.inarow.net/">Proudest Father</a></p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to implement this project in perl, for several reasons:</p>

<ul><li>Familiarity with several <span class="caps">CPAN</span> modules for handling email</li>

	<li>A desire to dig further into Template-Toolkit, after playing around with <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org/">catalyst</a>.</li>

	<li>An expectation that most of the project would be manipulating strings.</li>

</ul><p>With this in mind, I set out to complete this project in an evening…</p>

<pre><code> 5:30	Start

 5:35	README and templates/index.tpl created

 6:00	AutoBlogger::Post.pm created

		This involved learning some basics about perl objects.

		Experimented with Class::Std and h2xs to make a Module

		Went with a very simple class</code>



<code> 6:10	Made autoblogger.pl and it takes arguments

		Found GetOpt::Long and applied it

		Verifies that pop credentials are passed

		Verifies that you give it a publish and storage directory that exist</code>

		

<code> 6:15	Mail::POP3Client chosen and installed		

		Net::Pop3 doesn't seem to do SSL</code>



<code>Coffee</code>



<code> 7:10	Pop Harness in place, need SSL

		Done putzing with IO::Socket::SSL, took a while to make CPAN install it properly

		Throw in a debug_tell() sub that takes a message and optional importance</code>



<code>Dinner</code>



<code> 8:15	Start framework for parsing mails

		Add --rebuild and --nopop to support testing

		Man, getopts makes that easy</code>



<code> 8:50	Ok, now I have lots of command line args, write a usage()

		Currently, the script:

			logs in to pop

			downloads emails	

			parses them out to find date, text and image</code>



<code>		Time to refactor.

			Goals:

				Raw MIME message archived

				Ability to just rebuild index, a single month, or all

				Don't recreate images when rebuilding, unless size changes	

			Plan:

				Break storage/ into months (storage/200712/)

				Put messages in their own folder

						storage/YYYYmm/dd_hhmmss/

							raw.txt

							MIME::Parser files</code>

		

<code> 9:50	Ok, that's rewritten and tested.  

		Onto writing out an index.</code>



<code>10:40	Rewrote it so that the AutoBlogger::Post class takes the storage directory for 

			the email in the constructor, and builds the object around this.

		Now to have it ensure that the thumbnails are there.</code>



<code>Snack time.  Hmm, pretzels.	 Housework, exciting!</code>



<code>12:15	Start and finish thumbnailing, make the size optional.  This goes quickly with GD.

		File::Copy::Recursive is needed to move the MIME::Parser files into their target 

			storage directory (mainly because I happen to have /home and my docroot on 

			different partitions)</code>



<code>12:40	Tweaks, debuging... w00t!  index.html is there.		</code>



<code>Ok, time for some Kingdom of Loathing turns.  (<a href="http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/,">http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/,</a> give it a try)</code>



<code> 1:30	Back</code>

 

<code> 1:40	Refactor out the index into a do_file

 2:00	Apply that to the archives

 2:50	Test, tweak template, site up with 2 downloaded posts, index and archive!</code></pre>

<p>At this point, the project is working and ready for a beta release!  Quite an evening, but good results.  I'm sure I'll push out updates.  I want to support passing in a date in the body of the message, for importing older posts.  I did take the time to create some usage details.</p>
