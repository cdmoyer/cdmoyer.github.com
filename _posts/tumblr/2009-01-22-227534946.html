<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/">Google's <span class="caps">AJAX</span> APIs Playground</a> is an awesome new tool recently released by Google.  It allows you to browse through their various APIs and view examples.  This is a great way to see what the Google APIs have to offer and get a quick example of each.</p>

<p>Even better, each example can be executed, modified and re-executed right on the page.  The final source your create can be copy and pasted, and each <span class="caps">API</span> has a link to the documentation.</p>

<p>Definitely head on over and check it out.  I follow various Google developer blogs, but I was quite suprised to see the breadth of their <span class="caps">API</span> offering.  Graphs, maps, search, blogging and more are all included, with great examples and an excellent interface.</p>

<p>As an example, check out this incredily simple way to add a scrolling <span class="caps">RSS</span> ticker to a page.  This will grab the provided feed, and rotate the articles inside the #content div on the page.  You'll want to check out <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/#dynamic_feed_control_-_vertical">the full example</a> to see the needed javascript files and provided stylesheet.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<pre><code>google.load('feeds', '1');</code></pre>

<p>function OnLoad() {<br/>

    var feeds = [{<br/>

        title: ‘In A Row',<br/>

        url: ‘http://inarow.net/index.rss'<br/>

    }];</p>

var options = {horizontal: true};



new GFdynamicFeedControl(feeds, “content”, options);

<p>}</p>

<p>google.setOnLoadCallback(OnLoad);</p>
