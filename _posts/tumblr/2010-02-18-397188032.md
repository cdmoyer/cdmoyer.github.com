title: GitHub has an API -- Adding your Repos to Your Site
---

*(This post is pretty old, found it in my tumblr drafts folder, but the code still works.)*

So, I was showing [Mike Canz](http://friendfeed.com/mfc5) my <a href="http://inarow.new">shiny new homepage</a>, and what was his reaction?  "How come the list of github projects doesn't automatically update like twitter and the blog feed?"
"I don't know," was my reply.

A bit of reading about <a href="http://develop.github.com/">the github API</a> and a bit of hacking, and Voila!

{% highlight html+django %}
<script type="text/javascript">
var nongithub_projects = [
	{ "name": "jThrottle",
	  "homepage": "http://inarow.net/static/jthrottle/",
	  "description": "Throttled jQuery.each() to prevent locking the browser on huge loops",
	  "fork": false
	}
];

var projects_to_skip = {"cdm-s-kol-greasemonkeys": true };
	
function github(user) {
	var repos = user.repositories
		.concat(nongithub_projects)
		.sort(function (a, b) { return a.name.toLowerCase() &gt; b.name.toLowerCase(); });

	$('#projects .loading').replaceWith('<ul />');
	$ul = $('#projects ul:first');
	for (var i = 0; i &lt; repos.length; i++) {
		var rep = repos[i];
		if (rep['fork'] == 1 || projects_to_skip[rep.name]) continue;
		var url = rep['homepage'] || rep['url'];
		$ul.append('<li><a href="'+url+'">'+rep['name']+'</a>; - '+rep['description']+'</li>');
	}
}
</script>

I'm not going to claim that this code is beautiful, but it's a fun snippet for a few minutes work.
