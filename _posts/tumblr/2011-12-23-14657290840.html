I understand there&#8217;s some controversy about the level of journalism and the accuracy, but if you accept it as a narrative-based interpretation of the events, it&#8217;s a fun read.  If you&#8217;re like me, this book will have you spending hours (during and after reading it) on wikipedia reading about nautical information, fishing practices, weather and meteorology.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s enough meteorological, nautical and fishing-industry information to make it an educational read, but enough character and narrative to keep you turning the pages.  You&#8217;ll definitely start to feel something for the crew of the Andrea Gail, and the tension rises with the storm, the rescue attempts and the aftermath.  Even if you&#8217;ve seen the movie, this book is still worth reading, definitely more information and breadth.</p>



<p>This book started me on a non-fiction-books-about-fishing kick, and I picked up a couple by Linda Greenlaw that were quite enjoyable, and I&#8217;d also recommend.</p>
